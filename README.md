# Trello Copy

## What is the purpose of this project? 
This is my first project ever. I developed this website for personal use, where I can organize my tasks better for any future project that I get my hands on.

## How does it work?

**Main Page**
1. You can make as many projects as you want. Every project has its own directory. You can create a project with the following:
   - Project name
   - Project description
   - Start date
   - Frameworks or libraries used (for the project you are currently working on)
2. You can edit a project, where the project name remains uneditable.
3. You can delete a project.

**Project window**
1. You can create a task, with the following:
   - Task name
   - (Optional) Subtasks:
     - Subtasks need a name
     - Once a subtask is created, it can be edited:
       - Edit the name
       - Change the state from 'PENDING' to 'COMPLETED' and vice versa.
       - Delete the subtask
2. You have 4 columns, where you can distribute your tasks:
   - 'TO START'
   - 'IN PROGRESS'
   - 'TO REVIEW'
   - 'COMPLETED'
3. You can move tasks by dragging them to the column you want.
4. Each task has a count on the left-hand side of its container, showing X/Y, where:
   - X is the number of completed subtasks of this particular task
   - Y is the total number of subtasks within this particular task
5. You can also delete any task by clicking the bin icon on the right-hand side of its container.

**Dashboard**
The dashboard component has been discontinued from the original project.

**Settings**
1. You can clear the entire data (projects created and their contents). **This action is irreversible**
2. You can toggle between a light and dark theme of the website.
