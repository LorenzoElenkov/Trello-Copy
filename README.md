# Trello-Copy

This is a personal kanban project (task management website). It utilizes HTML CSS JavaScript jQuery and browser localStorage for data persistence.

This website gives you the options to create multiple projects, where you can create, read, update and delete tasks. You can order tasks in 4 categories (by dragging): To start/ In progress/ To review/ Completed

Each task may have additional subtasks which can be renamed, marked as completed or pending and deleted (these options occur when hovering the mouse over the sub task on desktop or clicking on the sub task on mobiles)

The website has a light and dark mode in settings window and the option to clear the localstorage cache (deleting your all data).

Dashboard functionality was once planned to show some statistics for each project but decided to discontinue this functionality.

Wish you happy task organizing.
